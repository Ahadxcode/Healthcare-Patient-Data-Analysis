# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Data Analysis (SQL + Python + PySpark)  
This project simulates and analyzes hospital patient records using **Python, PySpark, and data visualization** techniques.  
It demonstrates **data generation, big-data analysis, and insights visualization**, making it suitable for healthcare analytics and scalable data engineering pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Synthetic dataset generation (patients & admissions) using **Faker**  
- ✅ Data cleaning and transformation with **pandas & PySpark**  
- ✅ Scalable queries using **PySpark** (Top diagnoses, average stay length)  
- ✅ Interactive visualizations with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- ✅ Resume-ready project showcasing **Python + PySpark + Data Visualization**
